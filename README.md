# Hola Amigos! 

I am Gargi Choudhary, a techie by brain & bofy and an artist by heart & soul.
Alongwith my passion to develop and build things from scratch by making use of new emergeing cool and fascinating technologies. You'll find me immersing into Dance, music and books. Trying to be: Jack of all and Mater of One kind of a person.

I got into the habit of reading books quite late, I'd say in my adult life only. This repo is my way of maintaning a list of books read, as a reference to look back at the journey of me running away from books to hopping to every new bookstore possible. It may be a long journey but I know it's going to be a highly staisfying one for sure. 

Till then Kudos to me for coming this far atleast, small achievement. Yayyyyyyyyyyyyy !!!!!!!!!
